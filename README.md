 # memories
 This was my final project as part of the Harvard CS50 course, in which I used flask to build a memory-sharing web application. The user registers, after which they can add any user as a "friend" and, once their request has been accepted, they can post a "memory" to that friend's page. Memories that are posted to you are displayed on your index page, so this is like a sort of shared journal for enjoying and looking back on fun times with friends. 
It uses flask for its back end, with all data stored in a SQL database. Javascript is also used to create the dynamic user interface.
